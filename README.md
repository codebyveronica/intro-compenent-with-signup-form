## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Java Script

### What I learned

I learned a lot about form validation, and I also practiced which type of input to use for each type of field (email, password, etc.). I also learned some things about manipulating inputs in JavaScript and practiced what I already knew, which was storing the content written in an input.

### Continued development

From now on I want to start trying to build slightly more difficult projects with JS, and also with more complex styles.
